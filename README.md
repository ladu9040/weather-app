# Weather App

## Instructions to Run the Application Locally

1. Clone the repository: 
```git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git```

2. Install dependencies: 
```npm install or yarn install```

3. Start the development server:
 ```npm start or yarn start```

4. Open the application in your web browser:
``` http://localhost:3000```


## Approach and Technologies Used

This weather app was built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and display it to the user. The app is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## The following technologies were used:

1. React: for building the user interface
2. OpenWeatherMap API: for fetching weather data
3. Tailwind CSS: for styling and layout
4. JavaScript: for writing the application logic



## Known Issues or Limitations

1. The app does not handle errors well. If the API request fails, the app will not display any error message.
2. The app does not store the user's location preferences. If the user closes the app and opens it again, they will have to enter their location again.
3. The app does not have a loading indicator. If the API request takes a long time, the user will not see any feedback.



## Future Improvements:

1. Implement error handling to display error messages to the user.
2. Store the user's location preferences in local storage.
3. Add a loading indicator to display while the API request is being made.
4. Improve the app's performance by optimizing the code and reducing the number of API requests.
